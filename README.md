# Pandas
Powerful open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis
Pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides powerful and flexible data structures, such as Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D), to efficiently handle structured data. Pandas is widely used in data science, machine learning, and financial analysis due to its ease of use and integration with other Python libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib.
# Key Features :
Data Structures:
  - Series: One-dimensional labeled array (similar to a column in Excel).
  - DataFrame: Two-dimensional table with labeled rows and columns.
    
Data Manipulation:
- Add, remove, and modify columns.
- Handle missing values (NaN handling).
  
Data Cleaning:
- Detect and drop duplicates.
- Fill missing values with interpolation or specific values.
- Convert data types.

Indexing & Selection:
- abel-based and integer-based indexing (.loc[] and .iloc[]).
- Filtering rows and columns.

Efficient Handling of Large Datasets:
- Optimized for performance with vectorized operations.
- Reads and writes large datasets efficiently.

Data Visualization:
- Integration with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Plot graphs directly from DataFrame.

Support for Various File Formats:
- Read and write CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, and more.
